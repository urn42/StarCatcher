StarCatcher
===========
Started with the Gosu tutorial; kept going.

This is me learning Ruby. Don't laugh. :)

Working on:

* Address keypress issue with shooting and warping (need to better understand interaction between user input and refresh rate)
* Add ability to charge shot power
* Fix explosion on player death (not working quite like I want it to)
* Get player name and save high score across sessions

To Do:

* Swap in different sound effects/graphics here and there
* Add player shielding
* Collisions?
* Bubbles fight back?
* Upgrades/Multipliers
* All The Things!

Change the game entirely:

* Stationary player, parallax backgrounds
* Story plot?
